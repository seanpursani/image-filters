# Image-Filters

Using the SimpleImage library, here are a few apps which apply a filter to any given photo.

Warhol_Filter - Creates an image which has the patch copied 6 times (in 2 rows and 3 columns) where each patch gets re-colored. This effect is inspired by some of Andy Warholâ€™s paintings.

Reflection - Returns an output image that is twice the height of the original. The top half of the output image is identical to the original image. The bottom half, however, looks like a reflection of the top half. 

Forest_Fire - Highlights fires in an image by identifying pixels whose red intensity is more than intensity threshold times the average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel.
